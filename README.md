### ToDo's
- [ ] What do I want this tool to do?

  - I don't want to have to check emails or app notifications on zillow or movoto.

    I want to get these notifications, but I don't want to look in multiple places.

    I also want more control over the notifications. No duplicate info, prioritized notifs.

  - I want to know immediately when a new house is up that I might want to tour without looking.

    I want to be able set a strict list of reqs.

    Threshold checklist e.g. 5 of 10 reqs are met so notif is sent.

  - I want total control over the search area (zillow draw tool).

    Would be cool if it drew for me based on input e.g. 1.5 mile from specified train stations.

  - Don't recreate functionality that Movoto and Zillow already have, just supplement them.

- [x] What tools do I want to use?
  - Go
  - Docker
  - AWS
  - Python
  - REACT + TS (if doing UI stuff)
